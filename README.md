# congenial-computing-machine

## 🚀 Overview
Congenial Computing Machine is an **AI-powered motion tracking and feedback system** for **dancers and swimmers**. It uses **pose estimation** and **deep learning** to analyze movements and provide real-time corrections, helping users improve their form.

## 🔥 Features
✅ **Real-time Pose Tracking** (MediaPipe/OpenPose)  
✅ **AI-based Movement Classification** (Dance styles, Swimming strokes)  
✅ **Automated Form Correction & Feedback**  
✅ **Web Interface for Easy Access** (Streamlit/Gradio)  
✅ **Customizable Training for Different Movements**  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **Pose Estimation** (MediaPipe, OpenPose, MoveNet)
- **Machine Learning** (LSTM/CNN for movement classification)
- **Web App** (Streamlit/Gradio for real-time feedback)
